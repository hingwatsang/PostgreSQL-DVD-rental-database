# PostgreSQL-DVD-rental-database

## Introduction
In this project, I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 
</br>

I analysed the database and answered four questions in this project.

## Questions
<b> Question 1</b></br>
I wanted to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories were considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

I created a query that listed each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

<b> Question 2 </b> </br>
I wanted to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. I Wrote a query that returned the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. My table included a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

<b> Question 3 </b> </br>
I would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. I wrote a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers.

<b> Question 4 </b> </br>
Finally, for each of these top 10 paying customers, I would like to find out the difference across their monthly payments during 2007. I wrote a query to compare the payment amounts in each successive month. I repeated this for each of these 10 paying customers. Also, I identified the customer name who paid the most difference in terms of payments.
